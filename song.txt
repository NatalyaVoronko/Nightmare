I'm building an empire
I'm building it with all I know
I'm building an empire
Starting from scratch it began with stones
 
I'm building an empire
I'm building with my body and soul
I'm building an empire
So little time and so much to do
 
I must say this is as good as it gets
So why you wasting your blood your sweat your tears
 
ooooo ooooo empire
oooooo oooooo build it higher
 
ooooo ooooo empire
oooooo oooooo build it higher

I'm building an empire
I'm building with the stars in mind
I'm building an empire
Thats one day gona scrape the sky
 
I'm building an empire
Thats led by my heart to know my home
I'm building an empire
And now I'm never gona look back
 
I must say this is as good as it gets
So why you wasting your blood your sweat your tears
 
ooooo ooooo empire
oooooo oooooo build it higher
 
ooooo ooooo empire
oooooo oooooo build it higher
 
Its gonna touch the sky
I build it higher higher high
 
Its gonna touch the sky
ooooooo
I build it high
